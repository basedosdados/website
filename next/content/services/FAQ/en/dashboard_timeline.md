We build a mock up (pre-dashboard with sample data) to define the design, types and placement of visualizations. This stage takes 2 to 8 weeks, depending on the number of indicators. The actual dashboard construction and validation also take 2 to 8 weeks, depending on data complexity and technologies used.

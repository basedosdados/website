Chatbot costs include:
- Server (virtual machine where the chat runs)
- Queries (varies by storage system; on GCP, up to 1 TB per month is free)
- LLM provider API calls (the most significant cost)
- Chat customization, configuration and data integration services

Infrastructure construction costs (storage, metadata) are not included. If needed, check out our Data Architecture service â€” it can also be part of your project.
